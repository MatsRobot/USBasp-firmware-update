# USBasp-firmware-update using GUI version of avrdude
Need to download the portable version of the AVRdude GUI from: 
https://github.com/ZakKemble/AVRDUDESS/releases/

1- Short jumper pin 2 of the USBasp that needs to be updated. This would put the board on Program mode.

2- Now join the working USBasp to the one that needs firmware update using the ribbon cable.
